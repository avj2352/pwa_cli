# PWA assets generator - Rust CLI

Creating a Rust CLI cause I just got tired of using online apps (with ads and payments!)
Also `npx pwa-asset-generator <your-logo-file> ./public` doesn't seem to work anymore !!

The `main.rs` script will:
- Take a source image (e.g., SVG or PNG).
- Generate resized PNG icons for various required sizes.
- Optionally, update a manifest.json file with the generated icons.

More features coming soon..

## Features

- Create PWA assets ✅
- Interative CLI ...(WIP)
- Create Favicon ..(coming soon)
- Create Favicon + PWA assets ..(coming soon)
- Create viteconfig with PWA ..(coming soon)
- Create manifest.json ✅

Hope you find this useful !!
